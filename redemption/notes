What should we do if we found a match

let small_awk_frag = ["$"; "1"; "++"; "-"; "2"]

LValue = [$ Expr]
frag = ["1"; "++"; "-"; "2"]
Let's say we found $ 

If we then go to Expr -> Num -> 0
This wrongly says we tried 0 and its no good.
When iterating through the list of lists we need to somehow demonstrate that we found a match.

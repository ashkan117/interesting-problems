# interesting-problems

Welcome to a few of the coding problems that haunted me. Currently these were a few school assignments that I faced. School and cheating go hand in hand which means the assignments where you could learn the most from usually don't have a solution released back to the students in order to prevent it from circulating. We never went over the solution nor did we even discuss it much. 

I'll never know if my reattempts at the problem are the "ideal" solution but I did this for myself to get closure. I simply wanted to go back to see if I can come up with something better and to just think about the problem and what makes it interesting. I think it's almost meditative to have these small (not a full scale application with users or maintainence needed) to revisit every now and then.

Problem 1: Introduction to OCaml
Problem 2: Solving a complicated Recursive Grammer through involved Higher Order Functions

Each problem has its problem statement along with my attempted solution and in depth notes about my takeaways.
